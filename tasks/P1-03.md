# ID: P1-03
## Title
Replace mock blog/RSS with an MDX content pipeline (fa-IR + en)

## Context
- Blog UI and RSS are currently mocked:
  - `src/components/sections/blog.tsx` has a hard-coded array.
  - `src/app/api/rss/route.ts` has a hard-coded array and links to `#blog`.
- The repo already depends on `@mdxeditor/editor`, suggesting intent to support MDX.

## Steps
1. Create a content folder (e.g., `content/posts/*.mdx`) with frontmatter (title, excerpt, date, tags, lang).
2. Implement:
   - post list page (indexable)
   - post detail page by slug
   - RSS feed built from the same source of truth
3. Add schema (BlogPosting) and add posts to sitemap.
4. Ensure Persian/English variants support canonical and alternates.

## Acceptance criteria
- RSS feed items are derived from MDX files, not hard-coded arrays.
- Each post is reachable at a stable URL and appears in sitemap.

## Dependencies
- `P0-06` (SEO patterns)

## Files to modify (best guess)
- `src/components/sections/blog.tsx`
- `src/app/api/rss/route.ts`
- Add `src/app/blog/page.tsx`
- Add `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Add `content/posts/*` (new)
