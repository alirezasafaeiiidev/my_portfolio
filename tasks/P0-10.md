## Title
Monetization scaffolding (plans, flags, gating) without external services

## Context
- Current app has no subscription/licensing logic.
- Reference patterns exist in `_ops/external/asdev-persiantoolbox/app/plans/page.tsx`, `/checkout`, and admin monetization settings routes under `_ops/external/asdev-persiantoolbox/app/admin/monetization/page.tsx`.
- Requirement: no third-party runtime services; monetize via local licensing/subscription scaffolding that can later be wired to a payment provider externally (out of scope here).

## Steps
1. Define plan catalog in code (`Free`, `Pro`, etc.) with feature flags per tool.
2. Implement gating at the UI level:
   - show “Pro” badge
   - block action with upgrade CTA if not entitled
3. Implement a local license key storage flow (client-side) and validation rules (no network).
4. Add `/plans` page in fa-IR describing value proposition and privacy.
5. Add admin UI to toggle flags for testing environments (protected via admin auth).

## Acceptance criteria
- A tool marked “Pro” cannot run unless user has an active local entitlement.
- User can enter a license key and unlock Pro features locally.
- No runtime external requests are required for gating.

## Dependencies
- `P0-03`

## Files to modify (best guess)
- Add `src/lib/monetization/plans.ts`
- Add `src/lib/monetization/entitlements.ts`
- Add `src/app/(tools)/plans/page.tsx`
- Add `src/app/api/subscription/*` (optional, if storing on server; otherwise keep local-only)
