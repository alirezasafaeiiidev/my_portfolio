## Title
Pass performance budgets (Lighthouse CI) on key pages + tool routes

## Context
- `docs/UX_SEO_AUDIT_2026-02-15.md` shows Lighthouse CI performance failing on `/`, `/services`, `/case-studies`, `/about-brand`.
- UI uses animation-heavy sections (e.g., `src/components/sections/*` with `framer-motion`).
- Toolbox will introduce heavy client code and workers, so performance discipline must exist before launch.

## Steps
1. Identify LCP element per failing page; reduce above-the-fold JS and animation work.
2. Add route-level code splitting for non-critical sections (dynamic imports).
3. Defer non-essential motion components to after first interaction or idle.
4. Ensure fonts are optimized (subset/woff2 + preloading) and images are not blocking.
5. Update `lighthouserc.json` target set to include toolbox pages once added (e.g., `/tools`, `/pdf-tools/merge/merge-pdf`).

## Acceptance criteria
- `pnpm run lighthouse:ci` passes configured budgets for existing public pages.
- After toolbox routes exist, budgets pass for at least `/tools` and one heavy tool page.

## Dependencies
- `P0-03` (to include toolbox routes in budgets)

## Files to modify (best guess)
- `src/components/sections/hero.tsx`
- `src/components/sections/services.tsx`
- `src/components/sections/featured-case-studies.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `lighthouserc.json`
