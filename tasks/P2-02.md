# ID: P2-02
## Title
Batch processing queue (multi-file jobs, resumable UX)

## Context
- Many users compress/convert many files at once; queue avoids crashes.

## Steps
1. Implement a queue manager that processes jobs sequentially in workers.
2. Persist queue state (optional) and allow cancel/retry.
3. Add UI to show queue progress and per-job errors.

## Acceptance criteria
- User can add 10 images and process them without freezing UI.
- Cancelling stops remaining jobs and frees worker resources.

## Dependencies
- `P0-05`
- `P0-09`

## Files to modify (best guess)
- `src/lib/workers/*`
- Add `src/lib/queue/*`
- Tool pages under `src/app/(tools)/**`
