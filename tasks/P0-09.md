## Title
MVP Tool: Image Compress/Resize (local-first, worker-based, Persian UX)

## Context
- Image compression/resizing is a core conversion driver and must be mobile-friendly.
- Reference worker exists in `_ops/external/asdev-persiantoolbox/features/image-tools/workers/image-tools.worker.ts`.

## Steps
1. Add an image worker using `OffscreenCanvas` and `createImageBitmap` with:
   - output format selection (JPG/PNG/WebP)
   - quality slider
   - max width/height constraints
2. Create route `src/app/(tools)/image-tools/compress/page.tsx` (or equivalent) with:
   - before/after size comparison in Persian digits
   - download output
   - batch support optional (single image OK for MVP)
3. Handle browsers without OffscreenCanvas:
   - fallback to main-thread canvas with explicit warning, or show “unsupported”.
4. Record history entry (from `P0-04`).

## Acceptance criteria
- Compressing a JPG reduces size and downloads correct output format.
- Shows progress and keeps UI responsive when using worker.
- Works offline after first load (with PWA task).

## Dependencies
- `P0-03`
- `P0-05`
- `P0-04`

## Files to modify (best guess)
- Add `src/features/image-tools/workers/image-tools.worker.ts`
- Add `src/features/image-tools/workerClient.ts`
- Add `src/app/(tools)/image-tools/compress/page.tsx`
- Add `src/components/features/image-tools/*` (new)
