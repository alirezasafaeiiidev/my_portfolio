## Title
Server storage hygiene for uploaded attachments (retention, quotas, cleanup)

## Context
- Lead endpoint stores attachments on disk:
  - `src/app/api/leads/route.ts` writes to `storage/leads/*`.
- Without quotas/cleanup, this can fill disk on VPS and become a security/ops risk.

## Steps
1. Add configurable retention and size quota (env-controlled).
2. Add an admin-only endpoint to list/delete stored attachments metadata (do not expose publicly).
3. Add a periodic cleanup script (invoked via cron/PM2 ecosystem) to delete expired files.
4. Ensure paths are not web-accessible and filenames are safe.

## Acceptance criteria
- Retention policy deletes old files and keeps total size under quota.
- Admin can delete a specific attachment safely.

## Dependencies
- `P0-01` (admin access protection)

## Files to modify (best guess)
- `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`
- Add `src/app/api/admin/attachments/route.ts`
- Add `scripts/cleanup-attachments.sh`
- `.env.example`
