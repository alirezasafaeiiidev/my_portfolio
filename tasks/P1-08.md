## Title
Testing expansion for tools/workers (unit + e2e)

## Context
- Test infra exists: Vitest (`src/__tests__/*`) and Playwright (`e2e/smoke.spec.mjs`).
- Toolbox adds workers and heavy operations that need deterministic tests.

## Steps
1. Add unit tests for worker clients (mock worker messaging) and core transforms.
2. Add e2e tests for:
   - `/tools` discovery
   - PDF merge happy path (small fixtures)
   - image compress happy path
3. Add regression tests for offline route behavior (PWA).

## Acceptance criteria
- `pnpm run test` covers worker clients and tool registry contracts.
- `pnpm run test:e2e:smoke` (or a new toolbox suite) validates core tool flows.

## Dependencies
- `P0-03`
- `P0-08`
- `P0-09`

## Files to modify (best guess)
- Add `src/__tests__/features/pdf-tools/*`
- Add `src/__tests__/features/image-tools/*`
- Add `e2e/tools.spec.mjs`
