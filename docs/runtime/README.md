# Runtime Evidence

Canonical location for operational runtime evidence.

## Folders
- `docs/runtime/GoNoGo_Evidence/`: generated go/no-go release evidence bundles.
- `docs/runtime/Incidents/`: rollback drill and incident notes.

## Notes
- Keep this directory lightweight and current.
- Historical bulk logs should stay outside git (artifacts/log storage).

## Action Docs
- `docs/runtime/EXECUTION_NOW.md`: prioritized immediate execution phases.
- `docs/runtime/OWNER_INPUT_QUEUE.md`: required owner decisions for remaining non-local tasks.
