# Windsurf Rules - Project Constitution Summary
# See full rules in: .windsurf/rules/00-project-constitution.md

## Core Principles
- LOCAL-FIRST: Zero runtime external dependencies, self-hosted assets
- BILINGUAL: Persian/English with proper RTL/LTR
- STRICT CODE: TypeScript strict, zero `any`, Zod validation
- UI/UX: WCAG AA, mobile-first, professional design
- TESTED: Unit, integration, E2E, a11y, offline tests
- DOCUMENTED: Every change documented with evidence

## Communication
- Explanations: Persian (Farsi)
- Code/Commits: English or bilingual
- Evidence required: file paths + snippets

## Non-Negotiables
1. No external CDN fonts/scripts without local fallback
2. External analytics OFF by default
3. All claims must have evidence
4. Run verify.sh before push
5. Conventional commits

## Verification
- scripts/verify.sh - lint, test, build
- scripts/offline-external-scan.sh - check external requests
